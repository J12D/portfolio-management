\chapter{Become active regarding your wealth}
First we would like to introduce JD Investments and ourselves.
JD Investments is one of the leading investment organizations.
The company offers institutions traditional and alternative investments across all major asset classes.
We offer our clients first-rate product management and a consistently superior client service platform.
 
We are JD Investments’ team of most experienced portfolio managers.
With a high level of market experience, global expertise and one of the smallest but most successful asset management team for active asset allocation and risk mitigation in Europe.
The following factors make us specialists in our industry: 

\begin{itemize}
\item[$\checkmark$] Diversified active portfolio manager
\item[$\checkmark$] Global investment and research capabilities 
\item[$\checkmark$] Consultative local delivery 
\item[$\checkmark$] Forward looking investment strategies 
\end{itemize}

We would like to guide you through our investment process and advise you with an investment that is tailored to your individual needs.
You came to us as an experienced investor, looking to expand your investment portfolio with the following five assets: DAX, Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nikkei 225, iPath S\&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN and the risk free rate (Euribor).
We have compiled an overview of various portfolio strategies that would fit to your risk mentality.
Furthermore, we backtested these strategies, in order to see which of these would fit best to your return expectations.
  
In putting together our portfolio proposals, we worked with a special focus on meeting your demands that are summarized as follows:
Portfolios should (a) have a low turnover/transaction costs, (b) not allow for big drawdowns, (c) maximal Sharpe Ratio under these constraints.
Accordingly, we have set up constraints to (a) limit turnover to $10 \pm 2\%$, p.a., (b) put a cap on maximum drawdown of less than 10\% p.a., (c) maximize realized Sharpe ratio.

In the following proposal we will start off by introducing the asset classes you have selected and our view on them.
The proposal includes a detailed description of our investment philosophy, since it is essential to understand the optimization procedure and the tools used for portfolio construction.
This is followed by a summary of selected, tailor-made portfolios for you, as well as our personal recommendation.

%
\paragraph{DAX} is a German capitalization-weighted (in EUR) stock market index that includes the top 30 (blue chip) German companies trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
The DAX is considered to be one of the most important indices for European investors, since the German economy is the fourth largest in the world/the largest in Europe.
Furthermore, many DAX companies are heavily export oriented, giving investors broad exposure to global markets. In fact, more than 75\% of DAX revenues stem from international markets, indicating a sound international diversification.

%
\paragraph{Dow Jones Industrial Average} is a price-weighted (in USD) stock market index that describes the stock performance of 30 large publicly owned companies based in the United States.
The index proved itself as very stable and able to overcome large market downturns, since most companies in the index are well-established and internationally diversified.
Given America's status as the world's leading economy, the Dow Jones offers investors the chance to participate in the growth of the most influential companies in the US.

\paragraph{Nikkei 225} is a price-weighted (in Yen) stock market index for the Tokyo Stock Exchange and is considered as the best average representative of the Japanese Market.
The Japanese economy is the world’s third largest and is assumed to enter a recovery phase after two decades of stagnation.
Japan's economy leads all world economies in various measures that are testament for its impressive potential for innovation, such as R\&D as proportion of GDP, number of registered patents and environment for the development of business.
Moreover, Japan is considered as mature market gateway to quickly growing Asian market.

\paragraph{Euribor} is an estimate rate at which European banks borrow funds from one another.
It is calculated as a truncated mean of quoted rates.
As of November 10, the Euribor rate was -0.004\%, averaging 0\% throughout November.

%
\paragraph{iPath S\&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN} is made of medium-term uncollateralized notes, created by Barclays. Its performance follows the performance of the underlying VIX futures (S\&P 500 VIX ShortTerm Futures Index TR) with rolling maturities of 1 and 2 months.
The main benefit of VXX is that an investor gets exposed to VIX futures without having to constantly roll them over, thereby saving on transaction cost. The correlation between VXX and VIX is almost perfect.
VIX benchmark index reflects market opinion and corresponding price of volatility of S\&P 500 Index over 30 days in the future.


Normally, in times of uncertainty the value of the index increases, so investor can benefit from going long VIX futures when realized volatility appears to be larger than implied.
Short positions in the VIX are taken when investors expect market implied volatility to decrease in the future.
Moreover, VIX has demonstrated a strong negative correlation with the underlying index.
That is, in 80\% of time VIX and S\&P 500 moved in opposite direction.
Therefore, when markets fall, long position in VIX futures should increase in value.
All this is also true for VXX, but compared to futures strategies (with constant rolling over), here we just take long or short position of VXX in our portfolio and slightly adjust it with time.


\section*{Our Benchmark: MSCI}
In order to show that we have a good performance we need to compare our performance with a benchmark.
Since we invest in indices of developed countries, the MSCI world index can be used as a benchmark.
The MSCI world is an index  which includes medium and large capitalization stocks of 23 developed markets.
Concerning the performance of the index in our out-of-sample period starting from 1st January 2013 till 30th June 2015 the annual return of the index was 20.597\%, annual volatility -17.867\% and corresponding Sharpe ratio –1.15.

\chapter{Investment Philosophy \& Investment Approach}
\section*{Our Philosophy}
Supporters of passive investing believe in the implications of the Capital Asset Pricing Model and market efficiency, which means that market prices fully reflect all fundamentals and hence an outperformance cannot be achieved.
On the other hand, advocates of active investing believe that one can outperform the market.
In this regard it makes sense to consider timing and selection in the investment process.
JD investments believes that one can generate return based on a careful strategic asset allocation and consequent tactical asset allocation.
We believe that the advantages of active investing outweigh those of passive investing.
A passive investor can unwillingly be very concentrated even though he wants to exploit all diversification benefits.
That is the case if the market cap in an index increases during the time he holds the investment.
With active investing we see in our asset universe a diversification benefit.

An actively managed portfolio may have the chance of outperforming the market since it weights the assets differently and may not necessarily own all of the assets in the benchmark index.
It can also use special techniques such as taking short positions in certain assets, which is not possible in a passive indexing strategy.
We as active portfolio managers want to understand our investor’s investment objectives and risk tolerance.
We use this knowledge to define an investment policy with risk and return goals, select a performance benchmark, choose an asset mix and allow for adjustments during the course of the market or changes in investment attitude of the investor.

By choosing the indices you wish to invest in and defining your risk tolerance as well as constraints you have already made your first step as an active investor.
JD Investments supports you in the next steps of active investing by providing sophisticated systematic solutions tailor made for your views and risk preferences.

 
\section*{Investment Approach and Assumptions}
JD Investments uses modern portfolio optimization techniques based on most recent research combined with subjective experience of its experts with proven track records in order to manage its funds.
Our culture of risk management and regular supervision of the portfolios is essential for our value adding client solutions.

We use a \textit{time horizon} of three years of daily data.
This implies a rolling window of historical data at each optimization since only then recent information has a similar impact on optimizations.
Furthermore, it is assumed that the added value of older data might reflect a very different market environment and therefore reduces the validity of information.

To adjust the portofolio’s asset allocation we can provide our investors \textit{rebalancing} solutions to realign the weightings on a monthly or yearly basis.

In order to improve our out-of-sample performance we use selected regularization techniques and constraints.
In the following we give our investors a brief overview of the approaches and their rationale.
 
For portfolios with assets traded in different markets at different times we adjust the variance/covariance estimation based on the procedure of \textit{Hayashi and Yoshida}.
This technique improves our estimation of the diversification benefit of assets being part of our asset universe.

Since past performance is a weak indicator for future returns we adjust our expected returns by \textit{shrinking} them towards the average mean.
Moreover, we use shrinkage as specified by Ledoit and Wolf to adjust the variance/covariance estimators.
Shrinkage leads to a better out-of-sample performance due to an increased stability of major optimization inputs.

In order to incorporate our market views in our systematic approach we use the \textit{Black Littermann Model} for certain portfolios.
Views on future developments as well as volatilities on those views are additionally used in order to obtain optimal estimators.

We are further able to propose our investors \textit{robust portfolio choices} which are based on robust statistics.
Our procedure follows Wang and Raftery’s approach\footnote{N. Wang, A. Raftery, 2002. Nearest neighbour variance estimation (NVVE). Robust covariance estimation via nearest neigbor cleaning (with discussion), Journal of the American Statistical Association, Volume 97, Pages 994-1019.} to find robust variance/covariance estimates.
The advantage of this procedure is that it makes results from our estimators much more robust against incorrect market assumptions.

In order to \textit{reduce the level of turnover} and hence cut transaction costs several techniques are selectively used.
Reducing active exposure by keeping some positions fixed or changing to larger optimization frequencies both leads to a smaller turnover.
Further, maximum allocation constraints are used to drive down turnover and reduce transaction costs in each point in time of the optimization.
Generally, our procedure is based on the method of Goldfarb and Idnani\footnote{D. Goldfarb, A. Idnani, 1983. A numerically stable dual method for solving strictly convex quadratic programs, Mathematical Programming, Volume 27, Pages 1-33.}, enabling us to include both short-sale and maximum allocation constraints in our optimization.

To prevent large drawdowns in certain portfolio strategies, market exposure of the fund is reduced by investing parts of the portfolios in assets with low volatility e.g. the risk free asset.

Further, long positions in implied volatility are used to exploit negative correlation to stocks in order to further reduce large drawdowns.
For risk taking investors we also provide solutions where volatility is sold as one source of return in order to leverage on opportunities.
In general implied volatility as an asset is treated with highest care in JD Investments Funds as it reacts completely different than value assets.
Implied volatility as an asset is solely used in order to increase or decrease volatility of a fund such that it matches the investors demand and risk profile.

We provide our solutions in EUR denomination.
Currency risks are not hedged in our funds since we do not have an active view about them.
For clients requesting investments without currency exposure hedged share classes can be made available.

\end{tabular}
\end{mywraptable}
\textit{Mean Variance+ Equity Fund} has long exposure to the American, German and Japanese equity markets as well as implied volatility of the US market.
The asset allocation is aimed at minimizing volatility while not having more than 50\% exposure to a single market and not allowing for short sales.
Returns are shrunk in order to reduce errors in expected return assumptions.
The portfolio is very immune against stressed market conditions, as we also include the risk-free asset into our portfolio.% We further enhance diversification due to long positions in volatility.

\textit{JD Investments Equal Risk Contribution Fund} invests in the American, German and Japanese equity markets as well as a fixed proportion of the assets into the risk free rate.
Exposure is built such that each asset contributes to the risk of a portfolio in the same proportion.
The portfolio is rebalanced every month in order to carefully monitor risk contributions to the portfolio.

This portfolio is especially appealing to risk averse investors who care more about risk aversion than high returns.
An appealing feature of the portfolios investment process is that expected returns are not used, reducing the likelihood of incorrect assumptions.
Investors can profit from higher than anticipated returns on less risky assets in the portfolio.

\chapter{Conclusion \& Recommendation}
To make an in-depth analysis of the performance of selected portfolios we take a look at their out-of-sample performance.

Compared to the \textit{JD Investments Black Litterman Equity Fund} our \textit{JD Investments Fixed Weight Equity Fund} has with 17.96\% a higher rate of return. However, its sharpe ratio is lower. The maximum drawdown is also higher lying at 9.08\%. Both have a turnover of 0\% due to their static asset allocation.

The \textit{JD Investments Equal Risk Contribution Equity Fund} has with 13.68\% a lower annual return than our \textit{JD Investments Black Litterman Equity Fund} and \textit{JD Investments Fixed Weight Equity Fund}. It also has a lower volatility and maximum drawdown. With 1.49 it has a higher sharpe ratio than the latter two. Turnover is 11.53\% with transaction costs of 0.06\%. 

Of the five portfolios introduced the \textit{JD Investments Robust Minimum Variance Equity Fund} has the highest attainable performance. The \textit{JD Investments Robust Minimum Variance Equity Fund} has a higher sharpe ratio than the \textit{JD Investments Fixed Weight Equity Fund} but it is lower than for the \textit{JD Investments Equal Risk Contribution Equity Fund} and \textit{JD Investments Black Litterman Equity Fund}. The maximum drawdown is lower than for \textit{JD Investments Black Litterman Equity Fund} and \textit{JD Investments Fixed Weight Equity Fund} but higher than the equal risk portfolio. The turnover is higher than for \textit{JD Investments Black Litterman Equity Fund} and \textit{JD Investments Fixed Weight Equity Fund} but lower than the \textit{JD Investments Robust Minimum Variance Equity Fund}. Transaction costs amount to 0.05\%.

The \textit{JD Investments Mean Variance with Maximum Allocation and Shortsale Constraint Equity Fund} has the lowest return compared to the other four funds and the lowest sharpe ratio. Respectively, it also has the lowest volatility and maximum drawdown. Turnover is 12.10\% and transaction costs are 0.06\%. Given the discussion above, it can be seen that choosing an optimal portfolio is not a straightforward task as it might look on first sight. The decision for the optimal portfolio is based on investor’s constraints and implied risk aversion. 

After comparing the performance metrics of the five portfolios we believe that the \textit{JD Investments Equal Risk Contribution Equity Fund} is the best portfolio choice for you. Even though it has a lower performance than the \textit{JD Investments Fixed Weight Equity Fund}, \textit{JD Investments Black Litterman Equity Fund} and \textit{JD Investments Robust Minimum Variance Equity Fund} we believe it fits best to your investment needs. Of the five portfolios it has the highest sharpe ratio which means that it gives you the highest risk-return trade-off. Secondly, it is the only portfolio that generates a statistically significant positive alpha. This means that it is evident that you are benefiting from us as we proved to make solid investment decisions.

%\chapter{M Squared}
%Because our portfolios have different volatilities compared to the benchmark we use Modigliani Squared formula to obtain risk-adjusted returns of our portfolios. Afterwards, we could directly compare returns of our portfolios to those of the index and confirm that our portfolios outperform the benchmark not because of higher risks but because of high-level analysis and research that we conduct in order to find best – way solutions. To obtain $M^2$ returns, we scale Sharpe ratios of our portfolios by volatility of the benchmark and add risk-free rate. Since our risk-free rate is Euribor 6M, for this period of time it averaged to zero, so we need just scaling to obtain risk-adjusted return of our portfolios. In formula terms, it looks as follows:

%\begin{align*}
  %M^2 = S \cdot \sigma_{MSCI} = \mu_P \cdot \frac{\sigma_{MSCI}}{\sigma_P}
%\end{align*}

%$M^2$ has many benefits in comparison to Sharpe ratio as performance criteria.  First reason is that it could be difficult to compare portfolios with different Sharpe ratios, since the difference between them is not easily interpretable (we know that one Sharpe ratio is larger than another, but is this difference significant?). Secondly, it is hard to explain negative Sharpe ratios. Since we are always transparent to our clients we use M squared risk-adjusted returns, so that clients could compare returns of our portfolios directly to a benchmark and decide what suits them the best.

From the beginning of 2013 to the middle of 2015, MSR portfolio delivered return of over 17\% annually, while volatility was moderate and amounted to 12.05\%.

\newpage\section*{4 -- Equal Weight Leveraged}
EWL portfolio offers investor asset allocation into three different markets, namely US, German and Japanese. Weights in the portfolio are equally distributed with each asset class consisting of 36\% of total portfolio value. Furthermore, investor’s return will be enhanced by shorting VXX index that is predicted to have a bear run in the near future. Portfolio has no holdings in riskless assets, and invests heavily into diversified market indices. As shown in the figure below, portfolio has performed extremely well over the past two years. In this period EWL portfolio achieved return of more than 21\% with considerably lower volatility.

\chapter{Code}
We developed our asset allocation algorithms in R. In the following section, we would like to briefly explain the basic rationaly behind each module of our software. Each module fulfills a disinct function:
\begin{description}
  \item[0-helper] Support of data visualization and export
  \item[1-save data] Download of historic data from Yahoo Finance, Quandl and other sources
  \item[1-data] Basic data preparation tasks
  \item[2-analysis] Model specification, regularization techniques, Evaluation logic
  \item[2-application] Composition of portfolios through abstraction of portfolio models and parameters into a ``job'' data structure; Data structure is passed into a ``run job'' function which returns a data structure containing, (a) individual asset weights, (b) overall portfolio value (c) generated portfolio weights (d) computed performance measures (e) original job specification\\ This data structure can then be processed/evaluated appropriately. The way in which the models and job processing is structured, allows the specification and evaluation of a portfolio by means of composition of idempotent functions.
  \item[3-analysis2] Numerical optimization algorithm to incorporate maximum allocation/short-sale constraints
  \item[mdd] Algorithm for calculating the maximum drawdown of a given timeseries
