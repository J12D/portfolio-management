\chapter{Become active regarding your wealth}
First we would like to introduce ourselves and JD investments.
JD investments is one of the world’s leading investment organizations with an asset under management of over EUR 132 billion.
The company offers institutions traditional and alternative investments across all major asset classes.
We offer our clients first-rate product management and a consistently superior client service platform.
 
We are JD Investments’ team of most experienced portfolio managers.
With over 30 years of market experience, global expertise and one of the smallest but most successful asset management team for active asset allocation and risk mitigation in Europe.
The following factors make us specialists in our industry: 

\begin{itemize}
\item[$\checkmark$] Diversified active portfolio manager
\item[$\checkmark$] Global investment and research capabilities 
\item[$\checkmark$] Consultative local delivery 
\item[$\checkmark$] Forward looking investment strategies 
\end{itemize}

We would like to guide you through our investment process and advise you with an investment that is tailored to your individual needs.
You came to us as an experienced investor looked to expand your investment portfolio with the following five assets: DAX, Dow Jones Industrial, Nikkei 225, iPath S\&P 500 and the risk free rate (Euribor).
We have compiled an overview of various portfolio strategies that would fit to your risk mentality.
Furthermore we back-tested these strategies, in order to see which of these would fit best to your return expectations.
  
In our first interaction you have set some limitations in our investment strategy which we took into account in order to create the portfolios customized to your needs.
You stated that you do not wish high transaction costs, are relatively risk averse and want maximum return.
Therefore we have set up constraints to limit turnover to 10+-2\%, p.
a., limit drawdown to less than 10\% p.a. and maximize realized Sharpe ratio.

In the following proposal we will start off by introducing the asset classes you have selected and our view on them.
Afterwards we will give a brief summary of the current market environment that is monitored by our highly-renown economic analysts.
The proposal includes a detailed description of our investment philosophy, since it is the key to understanding how we have optimized and which tools we have used for our portfolios.
This is followed by a summary of the portfolios we have custom-made for you and ultimately our personal recommendation.
 


\chapter{Asset Universe}
Because investor is risk-averse, we invest in indexes of mature markets.
\paragraph{DAX} German capitalization-weighted stock market index that includes top 30 (blue chip) German companies trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Considered as one of the most important indexes for the European investor. German economy is the largest European economy (4th in the world) and in comparison to U.S., export oriented. Many of the companies from the Index enter heavily into emerging markets, exploiting the huge potential of developing countries. Leaders of revenues in foreign markets are Volkswagen, Daimler, BMW. More than 75\% of the revenues that the constituents make, come from foreign markets, so companies are well internationally diversified.

\paragraph{Dow Jones Industrial Average} price-weighted stock market index that describes the stock performance of 30 large and most influential publicly owned companies based in the United States. The Index proved itself as one of the most stable, that is less risky and better able to overcome large market downturns, since most companies in the index are well-established and internationally diversified. America is the world leading economy and DJIA takes the most influential companies of this economy, and investing in this index must be a safe investment in the future.

\paragraph{Euribor} (Euro Interbank Offered Rate) –-- estimated rate at which European banks borrow funds from one another. It is calculated by excluding highest and lowest 15\% lending rates and averaging the remaining. As of 10th November, the Euribor rate was -0.004\% (average Euribor in November is 0\%).
Nikkei 225 - price-weighted (in yen) stock market index for the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which is considered as the best average representative of the Japanese Market. Japanese economy is the third world largest. It is assumed by many analysts to enter into the recovery phase after two decades of stagnation. Japan is also leading country in the world for such parameters as R\&D as proportion of GDP, number of registered patents and environment for the development of business. Moreover, Japan is considered as mature market gateway to quickly growing Asian market.

\paragraph{iPath S\&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN} --- medium-term notes, created by Barclays Bank PLC that are uncollateralized debt securities, performance of which is highly related to the performance of the underlying VIX futures (S\&P 500 VIX ShortTerm Futures™ Index TR) with maturities 1 and 2 months. The main benefit of VXX is that by buying it investor gets exposure to VIX futures but does not have to constantly roll over these futures that produces additional costs. From the VXX performance perspective, it is almost perfectly correlated to the performance of VIX (according to Barclays, correlation is even equal to 1), therefore further, by describing usage of VIX (which are simpler products), we assume that the same is also true for VXX.

VIX benchmark index reflects market opinion and corresponding price of volatility of S\&P 500 Index over 30 days in the future. It is calculated based on implied volatility of the S\&P 500 Index at various points along the volatility forward curve. For the calculation of the index value, out-of-the-money put and call options on the S\&P 500 are used. The prices of the options of the current and the following months are taken to estimate one month implied volatility.  VIX indexes of maturities one and two months are used as an underlying for the construction of ETN. The weights of VIX contracts are assigned in such a way that ETN approximates one month forward market view on volatility. For example, as of 9 November, weights for CBOE VIX Future NOV 15 and CBOE VIX Future DEC 15 were 29.46\% and 70.54\%, correspondingly.

Normally, in times of uncertainty the value of the index increases, so investor can benefit from going long VIX futures when realized volatility appears to be larger than implied. Short positions in the VIX are taken when investor expects market implied volatility to decrease in the future. Moreover, historically VIX was negatively correlated with the underlying index. That is, in 80\% of time VIX and S\&P 500 moved in opposite direction. Therefore, when markets fall, long position in VIX futures should increase in value. All this is also true for VXX, but compared to futures strategies (with constant rolling over), here we just take long or short position of VXX in our portfolio and slightly adjust it with time.


\chapter*{Portfolios}

\section*{1 -- JD Investments Minimum Variance Equity Fund}
\textit{JD Investments Minimum Variance Equity} fund invests in American, German and Japanese equity market together with 6M Euribor to substantially reduce risk.
The asset allocation is oriented on volatility minimization while disregarding expected returns.
This portfolio is particularly suitable for the clients with strong risk-aversion, since it does not try to speculate on expected returns but rather cares just about reducing variance.

\paragraph{Portfolio Construction}
\begin{sit}
\item Long only equity exposure
\item Risk reduction through investments in Euribor
\item High concentration in risk-free investment (45\% of portfolio)
\item No assumption on expected returns
\end{sit}

\newpage\section*{6 -- Equal Risk Contribution}
The idea of ER portfolio is to design weights in such a way that each risky asset class contributes to the risk of a portfolio in the same proportion. Portfolio is rebalanced every month in order to carefully monitor risk contributions to the portfolio. Portfolio is appealing to risk averse investors who care more about low risk than high returns. Investor will mainly profit from higher than anticipated return on less risky assets in the portfolio. As it can be seen in the figure below, portfolio value is increasing smoothly without any significant drawdowns over the period from 2013 to the middle of 2015, and has yielded return of 13.68\%.

\chapter{Investment Philosophy \& Investment Approach}
\section*{Our Philosophy}
Supporters of passive investing believe in the implications of the CAPM and that markets are efficient, which means that market prices already fully reflect all fundamentals and therefore an outperformance cannot be achieved.
On the other hand, advocates of active investing believe that one can outperform the market.
Therefore it makes sense to consider timing and selection in the investment process.
JD investments believes that one can generate return by careful strategic asset allocation and consequent tactical asset allocation.
We believe that the advantages of active investing outweigh those of passive investing.
A passive investor can unwillingly be very concentrated even though he wants to exploit all diversification benefits.
That is the case if the market cap in an index increases during the time he holds the investment.
This means with active investing we see a diversification benefit.
 Especially as a consequence of the crisis people should be aware about the benefits of active investing.

An actively managed portfolio may have the chance of outperforming the market since it weights the assets differently and may not necessarily own all of the assets in the benchmark index.
It can also use special techniques such as shorting certain assets, which is not possible in a passive indexing strategy.
We as active portfolio managers want to understand our investors investment objectives and risk tolerance.
We use this knowledge to define an investment policy with risk and return goals, select a performance benchmark, choose an asset mix and allow for adjustments during the course of the market or changes in investment attitude of the investor.

By choosing the indices you wish to invest in and defining your risk tolerance as well as constraints you have already made your first step as an active investor.
JD Investments supports you in the next steps of active investing by providing sophisticated systematic solutions tailor made for your views and risk preferences.
